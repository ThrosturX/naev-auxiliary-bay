# Naev Auxiliary Ship Plugin

This plugin provides the necessary files to fly an auxiliary ship if you have the required outfit.

## Deprecation notice!
This plugin was made for an earlier version of Naev, and will not run on the current version without modification.

## Usage
Purchase the **Auxiliary Ship Bay** at any outfitter that sells trading (cargo) outfits and install it on your ship.
Once you have installed the outfit, you can go for a *joyride* by opening the menu and pressing **S** or clicking the **Launch Auxiliary Ship** button.

While *joyriding* in a cargo shuttle, you will be unable to dock, save the game or jump via hyperspace. Your ship will follow you as if it were an escort.
Board your ship again to return the cargo shuttle to the bay.

The cargo shuttle is automatically outfitted with potentially useful outfits such as a pulse scanner (if available), mining drills, cargo pods and a fake transponder (if deemed necessary).

## Za'lek Scanner Drone

This plugin also adds a new outfit, the **Za'lek Scanning Drone Interface**, which can be equipped on the *Cargo Shuttle* (auxiliary ship). If this outfit is owned by the player and in storage, it will automatically be fitted. This outfit reveals information about the outfits installed on a targetted ship by broadcasting a random outfit. The drone must be ordered to attack the target to initiate scans.
